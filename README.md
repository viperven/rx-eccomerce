Description of the project:

Let’s see how the things are working

1.	Basic implementation: User need to login or register to my site before using home page and other activities with respect to purchasing. For  that I used fire base, and protected routing with the help of this Authentication and Authorization is done. I used toastify package of react for displaying messages instead of alert. I made the components with help of bootstarp.


2.	In product section i made different filter options based on Category, Price and Color, and also he can search the product in search bar with name, category, price etc. After selecting a product he can buy that or put that to cart also for shopping other products as well.

3.	In cart section he can buy multiple products also ,the price will vary with respect to quantity. After clicking checkout button he will redirect to payment page (……………………………………) after order get placed that time he will get the mail from this site .


Future enhancement:
	This time it is the web based application , in future i would like convert into android application. And Admin panel  for product insertion and manipulation and payment gateway  I waould like to integrate in this application.
